This program reads in all of the questions from “qa.txt” to test you on them. They must be ordered with question followed by the answer line by line. There cannot be any unused lines.

It will ask all of the questions once in random order and then it will ask all of the missed questions until all questions have been answered correctly. Then it will restart with all of the questions again. You can type any of the commands at any time:

***help*** - print a list of all other commands
***quit*** - to terminate the program
***show*** - to reveal the answer
***repeat*** - will repeat the question
take a guess at the answer
